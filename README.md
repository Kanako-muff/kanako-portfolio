# Kanako's Portofolio Website

Hello, I'm Kanako.

I'm a web developer with a background in web design. I have prior experience working as a web designer, where I created graphics using Photoshop/Illustrator and coded with HTML/CSS/Javascript.

Subsequently, I pursued comprehensive front-end to back-end development training at CICCC college in Vancouver. As a result, I have transitioned into a full-stack developer while still leveraging my design skills.

Feel free to explore my portfolio website to see some of my previous work. 

Enjoy!
